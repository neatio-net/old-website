      about: {
        pageTitle1: `Who we are?`,
        pageSubTitle1: `We are a team of software engineers and developers passionate about blockchain technology with a strong belief in the freedom and privacy of each individual. Our team is a perfect blend of core developers and UX/UI designers. We all love Bitcoin since it introduced us the amazing world of blockchain technology, we also love Ethereum and the smart contract technology but since both BTC and ETH became store of value rather than a peer-to-peer electronic cash system (like it was stated in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto) we decided to bring Neatio to life.`,

        pageTitle2: `What is Neatio?`,
        pageSubTitle2: `Neatio is a decentralized peer-to-peer network based on blockchain technology like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Neatio network is composed of a main blockchain and multiple derived side-chains with the main focus on exchanging value (payments) fast, secure and inexpensive. Of course the platform is not limited to payments only, since Neatio can also be used by other developers to run their own dApps (decentralized applications) and/or launch their own cryptocurrencies.`,
        
        pageTitle3: `Our mission.`,
        pageSubTitle3: `We aim to provide one of the fastest and secure means of payment based on the state of the art blockchain technology. Why blockchain? Because it is decentralized and very secure. One of our main goals is to integrate the payment solution with as many merchants as possible, all over the world. Throughout, but not limited to our simple, yet efficient,  One Click Pay Neat browser extension. Note, the browser extension is not yet available, and is under development (work in progress). Stay tuned!`,


        feature1Title: `FAST`,
        feature1SubTitle: `Neatio is Fast. Blazing Fast`,
        feature1Description: `Neatio (NEAT) is an ultra fast payment solution, with a bloc time of way less than a second, 50 milliseconds to be precise. But since we think that anything under one second is negligible in day-to-day real world use, we enforced a space of one second in the consensus protocol. Even so, the protocol can execute a few thousands of transactions per second (TPS) on the main-chain alone, not counting the side-chains.`,

        feature2Title: `SECURE`,
        feature2SubTitle: `Neatio is secure. Ultra Secure.`,
        feature2Desc: `Making full use of the blockchain technology advantages and in combination with the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus protocol, Neatio is an ultra secure payment solution, since the transactions are confirmed as soon as they are included in the block. With Neatio there is no need for block confirmations, making it ideal for merchants in day-to-day use and in our crazy, fast-forward lives that we are living today.`,
        
        feature3Title: `SCALABLE`,
        feature3SubTitle: `Neatio is highly scalable.`,
        feature3Desc: `As mentioned before, Neatio blockchain is composed of one main chain and multiple derived side-chains all connected together acting like one single blockchain network, making the platform ultra scalable. In theory there is no limit on how many side-chains can run on the network. In our tests we managed to hit a peak of over 3500 TPS on the main-chain only, which we think is more than enough for today's scalability requirements.`,


        feature4Title: `ECO`,
        feature4SubTitle: `Neatio is ECO Friendly.`,
        feature4Description: `The Neatio network is based on the PoS ( Proof-Of-Stake) mechanism and is maintained by its validators, making it energy efficient, thus environmentally friendly. At Neatio you don’t need expensive mining equipment since you can run a Neatio network node on an average laptop or a $10 Cloud Server (VPS).`,

        feature5Title: `FLEXIBLE`,
        feature5SubTitle: `Neatio block size is dynamic.`,
        feature5Description: `What this means, and why this matters to you? Well let's find out first what is 'dynamic block size'. Dynamic block size is the ability of the block to stretch in size relatively to the number of transactions included in the block, the blocks are not fixed in size like on the Bitcoin protocol to 1 MB. On Neatio the blocks are stretching from 500 Bytes up to 20 MegaBytes. This is important scalability and blockchain size, and this is why Neatio can handle 500X more more tx/sec than Bitcoin.`,
